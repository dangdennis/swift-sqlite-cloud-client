# Swift Client for SqliteCloud

Use their official client https://github.com/sqlitecloud/swift.

Uhm. Writing a client for http://sqlitecloud.io because I want to use their database service from Swift.

My current approach is to wrap the C SDK. I'm struggling with SPM.

I might just write it all natively in Swift for sanity. I'll use the [Go SDK](https://github.com/sqlitecloud/go-sdk/tree/4d8ea27d11250af8f90752d808a015b6a93b0d21) as my guide.
